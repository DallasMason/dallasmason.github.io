    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <p>
    For this assignment, l created a resume and cover letter for a prospective job or internship. The objective of the assignment was to learn to describe my experiences and qualifications clearly to prospective employers. 
    They both needed to be professional in content as well as their respective designs. Both were created with the intention to be used as real submissions.
    </p>

    <h3>My Approach:</h3>
    <p>
     I approached this assignment by first analyzing job postings in the IT field to understand what employers value. I browsed all the entry-level positions to see what I would tailor my writing to. After searching, I finally decided on a Honeywell position. Using this posting, I structured my resume around the company. I added all my education, skills, and experience in my resume. I especially made sure the most relevant information appeared at the top. For the cover letter, I followed a professional tone and tried to link my experiences to the position, and a conclusion that expressed enthusiasm and readiness to contribute. 
     The cover letter was created with the idea to expand upon my general resume, and give more specifics of why these skills may be applicable to the job. 
    </p>

    <h3>Revision:</h3>
    <p>
      During revision, I focused mostly on my design and formatting. While I went for something different, it just came off as a little confusing and informal. In my revision, I reformatted my text to be left aligning as well as completely reworking my borders. I reorganized some sections to improve flow and expanded my warning to give more clarification. 
      The content of my project was pretty focused originally, but I reworded some parts to avoid redundancy and a first person point of view. Finally, I slimmed down the document to meet the 1000 word count and fixed the sizing on my heading levels.

    <h3>What I Learned About Technical Communication:</h3>
    <p>
      I learned that technical communicators always write and design under constraints such as word or page counts. This made me understand how important the meaning was in my word choice. With these constraints, it helped me to learn how to give my piece much more purpose and how to effectively communicate my ideas with the least amount of fluff. This project taught the idea of clearly conveying ideas and design that is digestible to a very specific audience. 
      This project gave mea better understanding of how layout, and organization contribute to the effectiveness of a technical document.
