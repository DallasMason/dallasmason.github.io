 <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <p>
      The goal of this assignment was to use technology and gathered data to create an effective, ethical deliverable for the intended audience to further research into UN SDG 4 Quality Education. 
      This was a group project that was created through a presentation and handout. The idea was to create a persuasive piece through data collected personally that could be shared in order to achieve greater social justice in our community. This work could also be freely shared with the broader community as well.  
    </p>

    <h3>My Approach:</h3>
    <p>
      My group first approached this assignment by first gathering information on our community. We first pinpointed a question that was relevant to our school, as well as applicable to a large part of the student body. Finally, we wanted to make sure that the aspect of our question was a fairly unresearched topic, to show grounds for further research in the future. We conducted surveys on campus, as well as having personal one on one interviews with students as well. All research was collected ethically and effectively. After gathering our data and seeing the results, we decided to create a presentation to show our data. In our conclusion, we found that the use of AI was effective within lower income students. 
      It helped to fill the gap of the assistance they could not originally afford. 
    </p>

    <h3>Revision:</h3>
    <p>
      During revision, I focused on the design of the document, as well as the presentation. Many of our citations were not consistent and left a lot to be desired. The presentations also had an abundance of information on them, making them very difficult to follow. This was improved by slimming down and summarizing the information. This left streamlined ideas left on the physical slides themselves, while the more detailed aspects could instead be told during our presentation. Minor grammatical errors were fixed throughout as well, giving the presentation a much more professional look and tone. 
      The info presented was also revised to be much more focused to our ideas and are significantly less scattered. 

    <h3>What I Learned About Technical Communication:</h3>
    <p>
      This assignment taught me that technical communication is not only about the writing, but the presentation as well. Good information needs to be supported with good style and graphics. They play just as big a role as the content does itself. Information dumps lead to a disengaged audience, which defeats the purpose of your piece. Using other forms of info such as graphs with the writing can only help to enhance a piece and is sometimes needed to reinforce raw writing. 
      Overall this assignment taught me how to gather data in ethical ways, as well as displaying them with purpose.
