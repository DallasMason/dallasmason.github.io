 <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <p>
      The goal of this assignment was to use technology and gathered data to create an effective, ethical deliverable for the intended audience to further research into UN SDG 4 Quality Education. 
      This was a group project that was created through a presentation and handout. The idea was to create a persuasive piece through data collected personally that could be shared in order to achieve greater social justice in our community. This work could also be freely shared with the broader community as well.  
    </p>

    <h3>My Approach:</h3>
    <p>
      My group first approached this assignment by first gathering information on our community. We first pinpointed a question that was relevant to our school, as well as applicable to a large part of the student body. Finally, we wanted to make sure that the aspect of our question was a fairly unresearched topic, to show grounds for further research in the future. We conducted surveys on campus, as well as having personal one on one interviews with students as well. All research was collected ethically and effectively. After gathering our data and seeing the results, we decided to create a presentation to show our data. In our conclusion, we found that the use of AI was effective within lower income students. 
      It helped to fill the gap of the assistance they could not originally afford.

    <h3>Revision:</h3>
    <p>
      During revision, I focused mostly on my design and formatting. While I went for something different, it just came off as a little confusing and informal. In my revision, I reformatted my text to be left aligning as well as completely reworking my borders. I reorganized some sections to improve flow and expanded my warning to give more clarification. 
      The content of my project was pretty focused originally, but I reworded some parts to avoid redundancy and a first person point of view. Finally, I slimmed down the document to meet the 1000 word count and fixed the sizing on my heading levels.

    <h3>What I Learned About Technical Communication:</h3>
    <p>
      I learned that technical communicators always write and design under constraints such as word or page counts. This made me understand how important the meaning was in my word choice. With these constraints, it helped me to learn how to give my piece much more purpose and how to effectively communicate my ideas with the least amount of fluff. This project taught the idea of clearly conveying ideas and design that is digestible to a very specific audience. 
      This project gave mea better understanding of how layout, and organization contribute to the effectiveness of a technical document.
