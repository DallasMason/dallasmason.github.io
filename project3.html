    <h3>Project Description:</h3>
    <p>
      For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a detailed set of written instructions for a specific audience. 
      I was given the choice to create the instructions on any topic of my choice. The purpose was to demonstrate an 
      understanding of how to go about dividing a complicated task into smaller tasks and use clear, unambiguous language and meaningful illustrations.
    </p>

    <h3>My Approach:</h3>
    <p>
      For my project, I chose to create a guide aimed at beginner computer science students who may feel intimidated taking their first step into the coding world. I wanted to create a set of instructions that I wish I had when starting out. To approach the assignment, I first looked at other tutorials available for other repository networks. I looked at the layouts and actual content they were providing to get a sense of what mine should entail. Studying this document helped me understand how headings, explanations, 
      and step-by-step procedures work together to support readers. I applied that model to my own project by including an introduction, a glossary, clearly labeled sections, numbered instructions, and warnings throughout.
